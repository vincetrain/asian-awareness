                <h1>Spread Awareness</h1>
                <p>Anti-Asian hate is a very real thing in today's society, therefore it's very important to spread word about all the oppression, hate and harassment that Asians have been and currently are facing.</p>

                <h1>Educate Others</h1>
                <p>Asian culture is a thing to be appreciated, not to be made fun of. Educating others about Asian culture is very important as it nullifies the stereotypes that were built up due to years of misinformation and prejudice.</p>

                <h1>Report Incidents</h1>
                <p>Unfortunately Anti-Asian hate-crimes have become a lot more present due to COVID-19. Because of this, it is important to speak out and report any instances of witnessed or experienced hate-crimes to de-normalize such behavior and inform the public that this is not accepted.</p>
