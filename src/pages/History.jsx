                    Ever since the California Gold Rush in the 1850s, Chinese immigrants have always 
                    been a target of abuse. Stripping them from their rights and claims, Chinese immigrants 
                    were forced into a life of nonstop labor where they worked in the mines for very little 
                    money regardless of the dangerous environments and injuries that they were prone to. 
                    Having eventually made up for around 10% of the Californian population and 25% of the
                    workforce, white workers were put into fear and therefore started targetting employers 
                    who had Chinese immigrants as their employees.
