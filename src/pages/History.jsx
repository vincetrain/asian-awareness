                    <h1>The "Anti-Coolie" Movement of The 1850s</h1>
                    <p>
                        Ever since the California Gold Rush in the 1850s, Chinese immigrants have always 
                        been a target of abuse. Stripping them from their rights and claims, Chinese immigrants 
                        were forced into a life of nonstop labor where they worked in the mines for very little 
                        money regardless of the dangerous environments and injuries that they were prone to. 
                        Having eventually made up for around 10% of the Californian population and 25% of the
                        workforce, white workers were put into fear of losing their jobs and 
                        therefore started targetting employers who had Chinese immigrants as their employees.
                        This fear placed upon the employement of Chinese immigrants instigated an anti-Chinese campaign running under the name of the "Anti-Coolie Association"
                        in hopes of banning Chinese immigration while defending white "vigilantes", no matter what they have done. 
                        An example of this would be during the time a San Francisco mob of white workers drove Chinese workers 
                        away from their workplace, injuring 12 and killing 1. After this horrible hate-incident, various "Anti-Coolie" clubs 
                        advocated for the innocence and justification of mob's action, winning the release of all 10 perpetrators

                    <h1>The 1871 Chinese Massacre</h1>
                    <p>
                        Although there was evidence of Anti-Asian hate within the 1850s, hate-based attacks occured often infrequeuntly until the 1960s. In the 1860s, the 
                        public opinion of Asian people drastically worsened resulting in more attacks against the Asian community, and leading to one of the most violent mass killings 
                        against Asians in history. The mass killings of the 1871 Chinese Massacre started off with the wrong person being somewhere at the wrong time. 
                        Starting as an altercation between 2 Chinese businessmen that eventually turned into a shootout, a white civilian was unfortunately caught within the 
                        gunfire, killing them. News of this murder quickly spread around the community where, combined with the pre-existing hate against the Chinese, angered around 500 white people to form into a
                        mob and start what was possibly one of the most violent murders against the Asian community. This mob went to the Calle de los Negros, a home to many members of the Asian community, and started 
                        ensuing revenge by wrecking and lynching any Asian present, regardless of whether or not they were affiliated with the shootout. In the end, 18 Asian citizens were killed where only one of the dead had 
                        participated in the shootout. Although some of the mob were put on trial, they ended up having all of their charges dropped despite the horrible manslaughter they participated in.
