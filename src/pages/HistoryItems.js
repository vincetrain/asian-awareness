        cardDetailedText: "Ever since the California Gold Rush in the 1850s, Chinese immigrants have always been a target of abuse. Stripping them from their rights and claims, Chinese immigrants money regardless of the dangerous environments and injuries that they were prone to. Having eventually made up for around 10% of the Californian population and 25% of the workforce, white workers were put into fear of losing their jobs and therefore started targeting employers who had Chinese immigrants as their employees. This fear placed upon the employment of Chinese immigrants instigated an anti-Chinese campaign running under the name of the \"Anti-Coolie Association\" in hopes of banning Chinese immigration while defending white \"vigilantes\", no matter what they have done.",

        cardDetailedText: "In the 1860s, the public opinion of Asian people drastically worsened resulting in more attacks against the Asian community, and leading to one of the most violent mass killings against Asians in history. The mass killings of the 1871 Chinese Massacre started off with the wrong person being somewhere at the wrong time. Starting as an altercation between 2 Chinese businessmen that eventually turned into a shootout, a white civilian was unfortunately caught within the gunfire, killing them. News of this murder quickly spread around the community where, combined with the pre-existing hate against the Chinese, angered around 500 white people to form into a mob and start what was possibly one of the most violent murders against the Asian community. This mob went to the Calle de los Negros, a home to many members of the Asian community, and started ensuing revenge by wrecking and lynching any Asian present, regardless of whether or not they were affiliated with the shootout. In the end, 19 Asian men and boys were killed where only one of the dead had participated in the shootout. Although some members of the mob was put on trial, they ended up having all of their charges dropped despite the horrible manslaughter they participated in.",

        cardTitle: "The Chinese Exclusion Act",
        cardDetailedText: "Considering how care-free authorities were in regards to practicing Anti-Asian hate, it was only a matter of time until government officials publicly expressed and reinforced the same opinions. The Chinese Exclusion Act was officially legislated in 1882 a means of controlling the Chinese population within the United States, disallowing the immigration and returning to the United States if you were Chinese. This act was supposed to last for 10 years, until Congress later signed the Geary Act in 1892, making the immigration and traveling bans among the Chinese last a total of 20 years. The introduction of this ban did nothing but further amplify the already-present racial favoritism and hierarchies present within society.",

        cardTitle: "The Rock Springs Massacre",
        cardDetailedText: "The recent addition of the Chinese Exclusion Act only further justified the beliefs and actions of Anti-Asian hate, leading to another mass killing against the Asian community. On September 2nd of 1885, Rock Springs, a Wyoming Territory that was home to hundreds of Chinese coal miners, was targeted by over a hundred armed white men and women with the intent to seriously injure or kill. Before this incident, tensions between the Chinese and white coal miners were present and continuously grew over a long period of time. During this period, white miners unionized with the Knights of Labor union, who convinced these miners that the Chinese were the source of all their problems. Although yes, this union was originally to help oppressed labor workers with the problems brought alongside the Union Pacific Railroad Company, it had also possessed a racist goal and sentiment. The Knights of Labor union believed that the reason why labor workers grew increasingly more oppressed was due to Chinese immigrants who were willing to work for less pay than white workers. After this tension between the white and Chinese communities reached it's breaking point, over a hundred men and women gathered around the Rock Springs area and killed 28 whilst injuring 15 Chinese people.",

        cardTitle: "Japanese Internment in Canada",
        cardDetailedText: "Thousands of Japanese immigrants and Japanese Americans had alreadyÂ established homes in the United States by the 1940s. Following Japan's bombing of Pearl Harbor, the US government placed all Japanese people, both citizen and immigrant in internment camps for the duration of the war on the grounds that they were spies aiding the axis, disregarding anything but their race. The internment camps that the Japanese were placed in often made occupants live through very harmful and stressful conditions. In the summer, the camps were scorching hot, and in the winter, they were bone-chillingly cold. Violence had also occurred very frequently throughout these camps. For example, when prisoners were transported by train to Lordsburg, New Mexico, and forced to march two miles to the camp at night, two Japanese Americans, Toshio Kobata and Hirota Isomura, were shot and killed by a sentry who claimed they were attempting to flee during the night. Later, according to Japanese Americans who testified afterwards, the two were both elderly crippled men and had been only struggling to keep up with the pace of the march. Despite the unjustified murder, the army court martial board judged the sentry not guilty. This behavior exerted within the Japanese internment camps lasted 5 years until the closing of the last internment camp on March 1946. After this, the government soon realized that there were no spies to be discovered and sent many of them home, only to find their houses and businesses had been vandalized or taken.",
